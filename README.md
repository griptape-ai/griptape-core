**griptape-core** is a Python framework that enables developers to write tools for generative AI middleware once and use it anywhere.

**griptape-core** is part of [griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape), a modular Python framework for integrating data, APIs, tools, memory, and chain of thought reasoning into LLMs.

**griptape-core** has three core components:

- **Tools**: call external APIs, access databases, and run arbitrary code or CLI commands.
- **Executors**: run your tools safely in any environment: local, containerized, or serverless in the cloud.
- **Adapters**: convert tools into underlying middleware abstractions, such as ChatGPT Plugins, LangChain tools, and Fixie.ai agents.
